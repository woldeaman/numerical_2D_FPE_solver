Numerical Solver for the two dimensional Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE). The generalized Diffusion Equation in two dimensions reads:
![nabla_c(_vec_r_,.pdf](https://github.com/woldeaman/numerical_2D_FPE_solver/files/6671488/nabla_c._vec_r_.pdf)

The solver works generally for any diffusivity and free energy landscape.
